# 3.10更正错误

-  if后加分号,age未定义

```cpp
if (age >= 65) //(wrong);
    puts("Age is greater than or equal to 65");
else
    puts("Age is less than 65");
```

- total未初始化

```cpp
int x = 1,total = 0; //(wrong) total;

while (x<=10)
{
    total+=x;
    ++x;
}
```

- x未定义，total未定义

```cpp
int x=1,total=0; //(wrong)

while (x<=100)
{
    total+=x;
    +=x;
}
```

- y未定义,如果y>0死循环

```cpp
int y; //(wrong)

while(y>0)
{
    printf("%d\n",y);
    y--;  //(wrong)
}
```
